- Sep 14, National Tsing Hua University: major in materials science, minor in computer science
- Jul 17 ‚Äì Aug 19 (**2.2Y**), HIGH5.ai: **ML and Full Stack Engineer** (founding team) \
  Designed a system enabling customers to retrain their own sentence classification models upon request. Later, took on the responsibility of maintaining both the frontend and backend codebases. \
  Stack: **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **Optuna**, **NLP**, **NetworkX**, **aiohttp**, **Angular**, **Node.js**, **Elasticsearch**, **RabbitMQ**, **Docker**, **BitBucket Pipelines**, **Kubernetes**, **GCP**

## Missions in aetherAI üéØ

The product was an AI pathology system, so most of the production deployments were done offline in hospitals.

- **Kubernetes**: Migrated the product from **Docker** to Kubernetes by integrating a range of open-source solutions, including **Helm**, **MicroK8s**, **MetalLB** (bare metal load-balancer), **Longhorn** (distributed block storage), **Patroni** (**highly available PostgreSQL**), **SMB CSI Driver**, **Elastic Stack**.

- **AWS**: Managing **EC2**, **RDS**, **ELB**, **EFS**, **S3** and **Storage Gateway** with console and **Terraform**. Found a solution to mount an **S3 bucket** as a **file system** with Storage Gateway.

- **Backend**: Designed a **network topology** not only compatible with 3 different product architectures: single node, dual node, and Kubernetes, but also secure for cross-node communication. **Nginx**, **Caddy** and **mTLS** were heavily used. Developed a load testing tool with **Golang**.

- **Monitoring**: Designed a remote monitoring solution for hospitals that only allowed outflow **SMTP** traffic. This included a **Python** sidecar, built upon **Docker SDK** and **Kubernetes API**, for periodically emailing metrics. An internal CI would fetch, process and store them in **Elasticsearch**. **Grafana** for visualization. **ElastAlert** for Slack alerting. **Sentry** for on-site monitoring.

- **CI/CD**: Responsible for optimizing all **Dockerfile**s and **GitLab CI** pipelines, managing on-premises **GitLab Runner**s and **Harbor** (**container registry**). Integrated **Earthly**, **Trivy** and **ArgoCD** into the CI. Identified the problem and designed a pipeline to create unique offline deployables for each customer, using ClickUp as the single source of truth. **Bash** and **Python** were heavily used.

- **Windows**: Ported a Python server to Windows and designed a solution to make it **highly available** and secure. **PowerShell**, **Nginx**, **Caddy** and **mTLS** were heavily used. Developed a toolset based on **Ansible Playbooks** for FAEs to install, update and control it from Linux.

- **Environment Parity**: Identified the problem and designed a unified toolset for developers to bring up their own development environments independently and for field application engineers (FAEs) to deploy various production environments effortlessly. It had to be compatible with both **Docker Compose** and **Helm**.

- **Mentoring**: Helped mentor the FAE team on Linux, Docker, Kubernetes and Windows. Additionally, provided on-site and remote operation support.
