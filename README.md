  We built an AI pathology system to help pathologists manage hundreds of thousands of digital slides and speed up the diagnoses with AI. As the sole DevOps, I had great autonomy in choosing solutions, but also needed to be accountable for potential costs.

## Missions in aetherAI üéØ

- **Kubernetes**: The advocate within the company. Migrated the system from **Docker** to Kubernetes by integrating a range of open-source solutions, including **Elastic Stack**, **Helm**, **Longhorn**, **MetalLB**, **MicroK8s** and **Patroni** (**high-availablility PostgreSQL**).

- **Monitoring**: Designed a remote monitoring solution for hospitals with restricted network access. **Docker SDK**, **Kubernetes API**, **Elasticsearch**, **ElastAlert** and **Grafana** were used. Introduced **Sentry** for system **observability** and **Prometheus** for internal server monitoring.

- **CI/CD**: Responsible for optimizing all **Dockerfile**s and **GitLab CI/CD** pipelines, managing internal GitLab Runners and **Harbor**. Introduced **ArgoCD** for **GitOps**, **SonarQube** for **static code analysis** and **Vault** for **secrets management**.

- **Windows**: Ported a Python server to Windows and designed a solution to make it **highly available** and secure. **Caddy**, **mTLS**, **Nginx** and **PowerShell** were used. Developed a toolset based on **Ansible Playbooks** for FAEs to install and control the service.

- **AWS**: Managed **EC2**, **EFS**, **ELB**, **RDS**, **S3** and **Storage Gateway** with **Terraform**. Found a solution to mount an S3 bucket as a file system with Storage Gateway.
